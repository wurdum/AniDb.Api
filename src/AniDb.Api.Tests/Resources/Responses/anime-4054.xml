        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="359836">Interesting characters and story, unique art style and an incredible sound-track. The story starts off fairly slow, but keeps getting more dramatic and darker up till the very end. Some of the later scenes are so good, that I keep coming back to this movie. A must see.</recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="590343">Seriously, this is a masterpiece. AMAZING visual style, solid symbolism, fantastic characters and plot. Action is out of this world, and there are some really touching moments. If you haven`t watched this, you need to. Stop reading. Watch this now. Go. I`ll wait.</recommendation>

In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

            <description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). To its inhabitants, our planet is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. The Earth is the main setting of most fiction, but many titles are set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, and in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by invaders.</description>

            <name>Conspiracy</name>
            <description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.

The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes &quot;all the way to the top&quot;.</description>

            <name>Thriller</name>
            <description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of &quot;their&quot; organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control. (Source: Wikipedia)</description>

            <description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.</description>

            <description>A sentou is a type of Japanese communal bath house where customers pay for entrance. Some Japanese find social importance in going to public baths, out of the theory that physical intimacy brings emotional intimacy, which is termed skinship in Japanese. Traditionally it is gender-segregated — men usually bathe only with men, and women with women. Usually used for fanservice purpose as it gives the staff the opportunity to draw the characters in the nude and raise the DVD sales.</description>

            <description>Social commentary is the act of rebelling against an individual, or a group of people by rhetorical means. This is most often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people’s sense of justice. (Source: Wikipedia)Since this is anime, usually, the mores of Japan and the Japanese society are scrutinised.</description>

            <description>The anime shows a world where many rules concerning accepted social behaviour are broken. This also includes a wide variety of `abuse`. E.g. to kill other characters is either not considered a crime or simply ignored.The world portrayed is the opposite of a Utopia.</description>

            <description>The anime starts off quietly, everything seems to be fine, but from episode to episode the signs that something ominous is about to happen increase. E.g. a typical mystery setting.</description>

            <description>Plot device: All or part of the cast visit an amusement park. Added to show the characters in a more leisurely environment (i.e. other than school or at home). Often used in school settings to &quot;develop&quot; and &quot;further&quot; the relations between the male and female leads in this anime. Can also set the stage for comedic misunderstandings, or private moments with possibly ecchi undertones. Furthermore, it gives the anime creators a chance to show off their characters in non-uniforms (e.g. school uniforms). Also see &quot;pool episode&quot;.</description>

            <description>This genre of anime is typically set in both the world as we know it (reality) and a world of dreams, mythology or imagination.Sometimes this dreamworld is actually real, sometimes it is not. Other times what we think is the real world is the dreamworld, and vice versa. They are not always easy to distinguish from each other, neither by the characters nor the viewer.Whatever is real, and whatever is reality, both worlds are integral in shaping both the plot of this anime and the development of the characters.</description>

            <description>Kuro is the older, more hardened half of the orphan duo who live together in an abandoned car under a freeway and protect Treasure Town from outside forces. The lost innocent, agressive, and an impetuous force of violence, Kuro is the child forced to grow up. If there`s no turning back for Kuro, his goal is to save what`s left of Shiro`s innocence. Kuro needs Shiro to feel worthy and to maintain his hope in the world.</description>

            <description>Shiro is the other, more naïve half of the boy duo he forms with Kuro. Far from pure, Shiro is clearly still a child, helpless, emotional and open to the world, but paradoxically all-knowing, in tune with the poetry of the streets. Shiro`s mind is a blank state, and his focus is on the simple, sensory things he likes - things that are soft, things that are shiny. Although Shiro senses that the world is falling apart around the two boys, he isn`t prepared to deal with it, and loses his tenuous grasp on reality as events unfold. Shiro needs Kuro to survive.</description>
