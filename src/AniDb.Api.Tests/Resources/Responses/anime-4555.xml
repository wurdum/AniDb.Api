            <name>Manga</name>
            <description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.</description>

            <name>Seinen</name>
            <description>In the context of manga and associated media, the word seinen refers to a male audience roughly between the ages of 15 and 44. In Japanese, the word means simply &quot;young man&quot;, and has no anime/manga-related connotations at all. It does not comprise a style or a genre per se, but rather indicates the publisher`s intended target demographic.</description>

            <description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). To its inhabitants, our planet is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. The Earth is the main setting of most fiction, but many titles are set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, and in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by invaders.</description>

            <description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not &quot;at the job&quot; this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time &quot;on the job&quot; for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

            <description>Art plays an important part in the story and has central meaning to the characters (e.g. valuable paintings, or sculptures). Alternately the protagonists show a degree of artistic skill, e.g. as painters, sculptors, dress-makers, potters, musicians, composers, designers, etc.

The anime will then centre on the development of those skills, from the unrecognized dilettante stages, right up to the moment of (commercial) breakthrough.</description>

            <description>A jdrama (Japanese drama), also called &quot;terebi dorama&quot; (&quot;television drama&quot;) or &quot;dorama&quot; for short, is a Japanese live action television series. Japan produces many drama series every year, from a huge variety of genres. Like anime, they generally air in three-month seasons or multiples thereof, with new shows airing every season. Some kinds of drama, specially the morning or afternoon ones, tend to be broadcast daily, while evening ones tend to be broadcast weekly, also like anime. Many written works (manga, light novel, ...) that get anime adaptations also get jdrama adaptations; that is the case for the works that inspired the anime tagged here.</description>

Narita is a man who knows when to be the boss and when to be the encouraging friend. While he is usually shown as being an amiable man who wants to help the other employees, he isn`t above yelling at the others to make sure they get their best work done and before deadline. It is never said explicitly one way or another where his sexual preference ultimately lies; but it is mentioned that Narita &quot;doesn`t like women.&quot;</description>

She is engaged to an unnamed man, though there are hints that her fiancé was the former boyfriend of coworker Maiko Kaji.</description>

He gets his job done but, unlike Hiroko, he doesn`t feel that one should devote their whole life to just work. While there are several people who clash with Hiroko throughout the series, Kunio is probably one of those that repeats the most, if only for their complete difference in work ethic.</description>

            <description>As the senior editor within the department, Tatsuhiko doesn`t seem to do a whole lot. He`s a rather laid back man and is often accused of being sexist towards the female characters (though whether that is true, especially compared to other male characters in the series, is debatable.) While he is very susceptible to flattery, Tatsuhiko also has his serious moments. There is a reason why he is the boss and when the stakes are raised, he is willing to step up and take responsibility.</description>
