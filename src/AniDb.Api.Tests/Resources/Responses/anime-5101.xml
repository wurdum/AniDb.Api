        <recommendation type="For Fans" uid="480768">Comments for this anime should really be disabled and instead there should be a box telling you to go watch this immediately. This is far and away the best, in my humble opinion, romance, TRUE ROMANCE, anime out there. I`ll give you money to watch this - it`s that good. You`ll be left craving for more and you`ll definitely play the VN. I`d rate this a 9,5/10 - I`d slap a 10/10, but that implies perfection and nobody is perfect =P</recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Recommended" uid="468891">Sweet. Lighthearted. Laughter. Tears. This anime has a fun and mellow feel to it, but surprisingly has the perfect, sad psychological touches that can really grab viewers. Also, the characters all seem to fit in their own way into the story. Clannad actually brings out different emotions from you, making it a great unique watch.</recommendation>

        <recommendation type="Recommended" uid="367685">Not your typical high school harem anime. I was hesitant to watch this at first, but was very pleasantly surprised. Clannad has a surprisingly good plot that handles some rather difficult topics. The comedy is hilarious and the drama is emotionally engaging. Most importantly, Clannad has awesome characters that you really start to care about. Great show.</recommendation>

        <recommendation type="Recommended" uid="554983">Clannad is a quite funny though moving show. Some characters have a whole story arc revolving around them, as in many harem animes, but the harem component is quite secondary in this show, in my opinion. The storylines is from times to times a bit obvious, but still the show is entertaining and little by little you get to care for the main two characters.I only recommend this season, but the second season, Clannad ~ After Story, is definitely a must-see. It brings the show to a whole new level, tragic and moving.Of course you should watch the first season before After Story.</recommendation>

        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="487479">A few years ago I tried watching the first episode and thought the animation wasn`t that good so I wasn`t gonna finish it. Skip to 2010 and I decide to watch it, it hooked me. Everything from the music to the characters to the storyline was so damn awesome. BTW, Dango Daikazoku is my lullaby.</recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="385944">Clannad is by far one of the best animes when it comes regarding life. relationships.The character are very well developed and the soundtrack is by far breathtaking This anime went to my top with Fuko arc, i cried so much.Give it a try, if you are a fan of this gender you will not regret ever watching it</recommendation>

        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="135495">I cant recommend this anime enough, my favourite of all time and I`ve seen alot. Its just just a fact of &quot;If you want to&quot;, this is a &quot;MUST SEE&quot;, and definately in the original Japanese, the dub doesnt do it justice. Best for story, soundtrack, plot, artwork and anything you can imagine. Sure with both seasons 52 episodes is alot but trust me, you`ll be crying half-way through!</recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="525522">I watched Angel Beats! and was searching for other animes made by the same people because it was so good. I found this series and other Key titles and have watched them all. I am proud to say this series (Clannad and After Story) is by far my favorite anime of all time. It has everything, except ecchi, that a perfect story need. It has romance, comedy, some action, character progression, and tragedy. I make a point to watch this anime every few months just because nothing really compares to it, and that`s saying a lot as I`ve seen a ton of shows. I`ve played the game(waiting on Tomoyo After to be translated) and this is honestly one of the best animes based off of a visual novel. You will not regret watching this anime. So sit down, grab your girlfriend/wife, and show her what a real romance is and stop watching those cheesy movies that they all drag you to.</recommendation>

This one was on my HDD for years since I was avoiding it... it`s just another show on my list where I am regretting that I haven`t watched it sooner. It`s a great comedy with likeable chars and touching moments.Though, I have to say that I enjoyed one of the specials the most (Another World, Tomoyo Chapter).</recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="550129">One of my favorites. I recommend watching &quot;after story&quot; right after, otherwise impression won`t be complete. And playing the VN beforehand.</recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="480721">Exceptional, daring, and bold are just some of the words to define the Clannad experience.  For a series to possess virtually everything except mechas, and tell it in a manner which draws in anybody who has seen it can only be the work of legends.    It has been my and many people`s experience that after viewing Clannad, you will be completely engulfed and desiring more.  Miss this series, and you will undoubtedly regret it.</recommendation>

        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="458655">For anyone that can easily enjoy a high-school-slice-of-life. Has pretty good comedy value within it. But there`s more to this show than just comedy. And with an amazing sequel!</recommendation>

        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="453138">A good anime to watch as a starter, this was probably the 2nd anime I watched and I loved it. If you are hooked in the first two minutes like me then you`ll more than likely love it. Little to no ecchi scenes which is a huge plus. Overall a good anime to watch that involves school and drama involving each girls arc.</recommendation>

Although he does not care much about them at first, he soon opens his heart to them as they get to know each other better.</description>

            <description>The upper-secondary education (not compulsory in Japan) covers the grades ten, eleven, and twelve. The students are typically fifteen to eighteen years old.

Anime centre on High School settings predominately: Plot/story-wise the coming of age is of interest - the students are almost adults (their bodies have matured, see ecchi anime) with more earnest, real-life problems.</description>

            <name>Dating Sim - Visual Novel</name>
            <description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an &quot;attraction meter&quot; which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

            <description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.

Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

            <name>School Life</name>
            <description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

            <description>Three or more characters, generally female, are under the influence of one character, normally male. Their interactions are romantically or sexually loaded. The female characters often draw heavily from stock archetypes. Sexual tones are applied to the lead`s behavior and to the members` depiction. The lead will often be physically abused for his behavior. The harem may be only a support to an existing or predictable relationship, or the lead may end up in relationships with most or all members.</description>

            <description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.

As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

            <name>Delinquents</name>
            <description>Every school has them, but not all anime with school setting make delinquents a central topic. There are several versions of these delinquents, though some are grounded on a misunderstanding:

    * The student with a really bad image and attitude, based on his real criminal actions outside of the school and is even feared by teachers.
    * The primitive &quot;class bully&quot; that pushes around (&quot;clobbers&quot;) his classmates for no apparent reason, possibly extorting lunch money.
    * The student with an sinister complexion or &quot;evil eye&quot;, but is actually a &quot;good&quot; student (unfoundedly feared character).
    * The rebellious student, who does not care for studying, but is otherwise docile. Called a &quot;delinquent&quot; as a joke.</description>

            <description>Parallel universe/world or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because &quot;alternative reality&quot; sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we`ll use the term &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own universe (meaning a fantasy world can just as well have an alternative reality, doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 universe/reality/world is present in the anime.</description>

            <description>A fantasy world is a type of imaginary world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to magic or magical abilities and a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

            <description>Usually girly tears are the ones not shed by men (duh). Like when a (stereotypical) girl watches something and cries her makeup out, a (stereotypical) dude just says, proclaiming his masculinity: &quot;Meh, yet another soap opera bulls..t, I`ll be in my garage fixing my ride while playing heavy metal on a burning guitar ...with my teeth! And where`s my beer, woman?&quot;.So that`s how it goes: girly tears are for girls and sissies! Chuck Norris forbid a guy would weep watching something that has this tag! Now 20 push-ups!P.S. The opposite of &quot;manly tears&quot;. Or is it? Let`s face it - it`s all subjective (and relative, and context-dependent).</description>

            <description>Somewhere down the line, it became the &quot;norm&quot; that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call &quot;manly tears&quot;. Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.The opposite of manly tears are &quot;girly tears&quot;.</description>

            <description>Derived from the Biblical story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.This tag is used to demonstrate the unbearable loss, the feeling of losing everything along with every single bit of happiness. It prerequisites a small peaceful period of happiness. The main reason for losing &quot;his/her paradise&quot; can either be the death/sacrifice of an important character or even a betrayal. Usually the anime loses a lot of its former glory afterwards.</description>

            <description>An actual starfish, or something in the shape thereof is important to the characters in this anime.Definition: Starfish or sea stars are echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. The names &quot;starfish&quot; and &quot;sea star&quot; essentially refer to members of the class Asteroidea. However, common usage frequently finds &quot;starfish&quot; and &quot;sea star&quot; also applied to ophiuroids which are correctly referred to as &quot;brittle stars&quot; or &quot;basket stars&quot;. There are about 1,800 living species of starfish that occur in all the world`s oceans, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian as well as in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean (i.e., Antarctic) regions. Starfish occur across a broad depth range from the intertidal to abyssal depths (&gt;6000 m).(Source: Wikipedia)</description>

            <description>Tomoya is the male protagonist of Clannad. Due to his habit of always arriving late to school, skipping classes during the day, and staying out all night, he has been labeled as a delinquent, or a young person who defies authority. Ever since his mother, Atsuko, died in a car accident when he was young, Tomoya has been living with his father, Naoyuki, with whom he argues constantly. Tomoya was injured during a fight with his father three years ago; since then, their relationship has been very distant. While walking to school, Tomoya met Nagisa Furukawa, since then, his life changed. Nagisa describes him as someone who is mean and bad-mouthed, but actually kind-hearted.</description>

On the first day of school, She meets Tomoya on a long hill path in front of the school. She has a strange habit of muttering the names of food that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as anpan. She wants to re-establish the once-disbanded drama club. She does not have much self-confidence so she often needs help in order to motivate herself through the day.</description>

She was in Tomoya`s class in their second year, and has maintained a steady friendship with Tomoya even though they are put in different classes on their third year. She is currently the class representative of her class. She has a pet baby boar named Botan. She even has her own motorbike (in this case a scooter), which is known only to Tomoya and her sister, as Kyou does not want the news of her possession of it to be known, as she fears suspension from school because she is not allowed to ride a motorbike to school. Her favourite weapon is various types of dictionaries, which are thrown at anyone she gets furious with, typically Youhei. In the anime, Kyou uses various books as weapons more often, and while Tomoya almost always avoids them, Youhei gets hit almost every single time.</description>

She`s quite proud of the way people often mistaken her as Nagisa`s older sister because of her youthful appearance. When Akio accidentally makes Sanae cry because of his accidental bad remarks on her bread, he will have to chase after her with her bread stuffed into his mouth, to calm her down, or else she will run around the town crying.</description>
