        <recommendation type="For Fans" uid="279344">In the 1/4 of the story. Good romance, interesting relationships and amnesia as a wild card... or the heroine? Your choice. With the story progress, I thought it will be 12-13 episodes series at first. Looking forward to slightly unknown in the next 18 episodes.</recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Recommended" uid="577587">Recommended for all fans of romance. I only watched till episode 6 and it`s going good. The main guy is interesting since he has memories loss and he tries to find is older self (Spoiler , my bad :&amp;gt; ). Not a waste of time. Btw my first review. (sry if it`s bad)</recommendation>

    <description>http://anidb.net/ch58576 [Tada Banri] is a newly admitted student at a private law school in Tokyo. Due to the after-effects of an accidental fall from a bridge shortly after high school graduation, he lost all his memories from before then. At the time of the accident, Banri`s soul had escaped from his body, and the Spirit of Tada Banri came into being, carrying his memories from before graduation.Banri finds himself completely lost after the opening ceremony, trying to find his way to the freshman orientation. At that moment, he runs into another lost freshman from the same school, http://anidb.net/ch58574 [Yanagisawa Mitsuo], and they hit it off at once. Somehow arriving at their intended goal just on time, there appears in front of them a beautiful girl holding a bouquet of roses, who hits Mitsuo across the face with them and hands the flowers over to him. This stylish, well dressed, and perfect woman is his childhood friend http://anidb.net/ch58577 [Kaga Kouko]. As children, they had promised to marry each other one day, fulfilling their dreams. In order to escape from her, Mitsuo had gone out secretly and taken the examination for this well-known private college, but she also took the law school entrance examination, catching up with him there.Source: WikipediaNote: The first episode was pre-aired at a special event on 23.09.2013, regular TV broadcast started on 04.10.2013.</description>

            <name>Comedy</name>
            <description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.

Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

            <description>Since college/university students are typically at least eighteen years old, with stories covering mature everyday life topics, you will find the college setting quite often in seinen and josei anime.

Topics that can now be covered - as compared to High School settings - are higher education (i.e. coping with higher intellectual stress), the more adult party life (i.e. alcohol, smoking, sex), the issues of daily life vs. studying - especially when having to work to pay for bills, and finally the possible friction between those in and out of college. </description>

            <description>The ojou (&quot;princess&quot;, called &quot;ojou-sama&quot; in the anime) may be many things (perhaps even a real princess), but she is undoubtedly rich, either in her own right or by being part of an absurdly powerful family. The ojou is noticeable by her shrill and obnoxious laugh often (if not always) while putting the backside of her hand in front of her mouth.</description>
