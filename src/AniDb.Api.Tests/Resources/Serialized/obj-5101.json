  "Description": "* Adaptation of the renowned visual novel by http://anidb.net/cr1046 [Visual Art`s/Key].Set in a high school located in some Japanese town. http://anidb.net/ch1113 [Okazaki Tomoya] is a third-year student who does not take his studies seriously. Always late for class, he is seen as a delinquent by the rest of his classmates who are busy preparing for their college entrance examinations. Needless to say, he does not have too many close friends either.Tomoya does not seem to mind though — until one day he meets a girl, http://anidb.net/ch1116 [Furukawa Nagisa], who is left alone without friends at school because everybody she knew already graduated. \"What a clumsy girl\", he thinks at first. But talking to her feels natural and so, while helping her, he meets a few other girls from his school. Although he does not care much about them at first, he soon opens his heart to them as they get to know each other better.",

Some characters have a whole story arc revolving around them, as in many harem animes, but the harem component is quite secondary in this show, in my opinion. The storylines is from times to times a bit obvious, but still the show is entertaining and little by little you get to care for the main two characters.I only recommend this season, but the second season, Clannad ~ After Story, is definitely a must-see. It brings the show to a whole new level, tragic and moving.Of course you should watch the first season before After Story."

It has romance, comedy, some action, character progression, and tragedy. I make a point to watch this anime every few months just because nothing really compares to it, and that`s saying a lot as I`ve seen a ton of shows. I`ve played the game(waiting on Tomoyo After to be translated) and this is honestly one of the best animes based off of a visual novel. You will not regret watching this anime.

Her favourite weapon is various types of dictionaries, which are thrown at anyone she gets furious with, typically Youhei. In the anime, Kyou uses various books as weapons more often, and while Tomoya almost always avoids them, Youhei gets hit almost every single time.",

Botan hates Ryou because it mistook Ryou for trying to eat it when she took it for a warm bath. In the After Story, Botan has become an adult boar, but still acts the same. Botan has seven different skills, told him by Kyou, one of them being able to take the appearance of a stuffed animal by being extremely still. Another skill is called \"Rugby Ball\" in which Botan shrinks his legs until he resembles a ball, allowing Kyou to use him as a projectile. These skills are considered to be animal cruelty by Tomoya. Two other skills are mentioned in the visual novel, but never shown, called \"massager\" and \"pillow\".",
