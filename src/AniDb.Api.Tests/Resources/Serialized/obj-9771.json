  "Description": "http://anidb.net/ch58576 [Tada Banri] is a newly admitted student at a private law school in Tokyo. Due to the after-effects of an accidental fall from a bridge shortly after high school graduation, he lost all his memories from before then. At the time of the accident, Banri`s soul had escaped from his body, and the Spirit of Tada Banri came into being, carrying his memories from before graduation.Banri finds himself completely lost after the opening ceremony, trying to find his way to the freshman orientation. At that moment, he runs into another lost freshman from the same school, http://anidb.net/ch58574 [Yanagisawa Mitsuo], and they hit it off at once. Somehow arriving at their intended goal just on time, there appears in front of them a beautiful girl holding a bouquet of roses, who hits Mitsuo across the face with them and hands the flowers over to him. This stylish, well dressed, and perfect woman is his childhood friend http://anidb.net/ch58577 [Kaga Kouko]. As children, they had promised to marry each other one day, fulfilling their dreams. In order to escape from her, Mitsuo had gone out secretly and taken the examination for this well-known private college, but she also took the law school entrance examination, catching up with him there.Source: WikipediaNote: The first episode was pre-aired at a special event on 23.09.2013, regular TV broadcast started on 04.10.2013.",
